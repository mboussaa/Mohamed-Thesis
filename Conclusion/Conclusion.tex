\section{Perspectives}
As a future work, we plan to explore more trade-offs among resource usage metrics \eg, the correlation between CPU consumption and platform architectures. 
We also intend to provide more facilities to NOTICE users in order to test optimizations performed by modern compilers such as Clang, LLVM, etc.
Finally, NOTICE can be easily adapted and integrated to new case studies. As an example, we would inspect the behavior of model-based code generators since different optimizations can be performed to generate code from models~\cite{stuermer2007systematic}. Thus, we aim to use the same approach to find non-functional issues during the code generation process.
%As an alternative, it would be great to test model-based code generators. In the same fashion as Csmith, code generators apply to same rules to generate new software programs. Thus, we can use NOTICE to define general-purpose optimizations from a set of generated code artifacts.
