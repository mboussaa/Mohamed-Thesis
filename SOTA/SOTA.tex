In this chapter, we study existing techniques related to code generators testing as well as compilers auto-tuning techniques.
Section 3.1 provides a survey of the most used compiler auto-tuning techniques to construct the best set of optimization options. In Section 3.2, we review existing techniques for code generators testing. Section 3.3 discusses the limitations of the state of the art.

\section{Iterative compilation}
Iterative compilation consists on applying software engineering techniques to produce better and more optimized programs by compiling multiple versions of each of them using different optimizations settings. After running these versions on specific hardware machines, the key objective of iterative compilation is to find the best optimizing sequence that lead to the fastest and better code machine code. 
Our work is related to iterative compilation research field.
The basic idea of iterative compilation is to explore the compiler optimization space by measuring the impact of optimizations on software performance.
Several research efforts have investigated this optimization problem using search-based techniques (SBSE) to guide the search towards relevant optimizations regrading performance, energy consumption, code size, compilation time, etc. Experimental results have been usually compared to standard compiler optimization levels.  
The vast majority of the work on iterative compilation focuses on increasing the speedup of new optimized code compared to standard compiler optimization levels~\cite{almagor2004finding,hoste2008cole,pan2006fast,pallister2015identifying,chen2012deconstructing,martins2014exploration,lin2008automatic,martinez2014multi}.
It has been proven that optimizations are highly dependent on target platform and input program. 
Compared to our proposal, none of the previous work has studied the impact of compiler optimizations on resource usage. In this work, we rather focus on compiler optimizations related to resource consumption, while bearing in mind the performance improvement.

The implementation of iterative compilation consists mainly on applying a series of steps to enhance the quality of generated code. Figure~\ref{fig:iterative_compilation} shows a general overview of the principal steps needed to ensure the implementation of the iterative compilation system.

\section{Testing compilers}

Novelty Search has never been applied in the field of iterative compilation. Our work presents the first attempt to introduce diversity in the compiler optimization problem. 
The idea of NS has been introduced by Lehman et al.~\cite{lehman2008exploiting}. It has been often evaluated in deceptive tasks and especially applied to evolutionary robotics~\cite{risi2010evolving,krvcah2012solving} (in the context of neuroevolution). 
NS can be easily adapted to different research fields. In a previous work~\cite{boussaa2015novelty}, we have adapted the general idea of NS to the test data generation problem where novelty score was calculated as the Manhattan distance between the different vectors representing the test data. The evaluation metric of generated test suites is the structural coverage of code.
In this paper, the evaluation metric represents the non-functional improvements and we are calculating the novelty score as the symmetric difference between optimization sequences. 

For multi-objective optimizations, we are not the first to address this problem. New approaches have emerged recently to find trade-offs between non-functional properties~\cite{hoste2008cole,martinez2014multi,lokuciejewski2010multi}. Hoste et al.~\cite{hoste2008cole}, which is the most related work to our proposal, propose COLE, an automated tool for optimization generation using a multi-objective approach namely SPEA2. In their work, they try to find Pareto optimal optimization levels that present a trade-off between execution and compilation time of generated code. Their experimental results show that the obtained optimization sequences perform better than standard GCC optimization levels. NOTICE provides also a fully automated approach to extract non-functional properties. However, NOTICE differs from COLE because first, our proposed container-based infrastructure is more generic and can be adapted to other case studies (i.e., compilers, code generators, etc.). Second, we provide facilities to compiler users to extract resource usage metrics using our monitoring components. Finally, our empirical study investigates different trade-offs compared to previous work in iterative compilation.



%For code generators testing, Stuermer et al.~\cite{stuermer2007systematic} present a systematic test approach for model-based code generators. They investigate the impact of optimization rules for model-based code generation by comparing the output of the code execution with the output of the model execution. 
%If these outputs are equivalent, it is assumed that the code generator works as expected. 
%They evaluate the effectiveness of this approach by means of testing optimizations performed by the TargetLink code generator. 
%They have used Simulink as a simulation environment of models. 
%In our approach, we provide a component-based infrastructure to compare non-functional properties of generated code rather than functional ones. 


\section{Testing code generators}
Previous work on non-functional testing of code generators focuses on comparing, as oracle, the non-functional properties of hand-written code to automatically generated code~\cite{stepasyuk2015evaluating,richard2013efficient}. As an example, Strekelj et al.~\cite{vstrekelj2015performance} implemented a simple 2D game in both the Haxe programming language and the native environment and evaluated the difference in performance between the two versions of code. They showed that the generated code through Haxe has better performance than hand-written code. 

Cross-platform mobile development has been also part of the non-functional testing goals since many code generators are increasingly used in industry for automatic cross-platform development. In \cite{pazirandeh2015evaluation,hartmann2011cross}, authors compare the performance of a set of cross-platform code generators and presented the most efficient tools.

The container-based infrastructure has been also applied to the software testing, especially in the cloud~\cite{li2015rest}. Sun et al.~\cite{sun2016roar} present a tool to test, optimize, and automate cloud resource allocation decisions to meet QoS goals for web applications. Their infrastructure relies on Docker to gather informations about the resource usage of deployed web servers. 

Most of the previous work on code generators testing focuses on checking the correct functional behavior of generated code. Stuermer et al.~\cite{stuermer2007systematic} present a systematic test approach for model-based code generators. They investigate the impact of optimization rules for model-based code generation by comparing the output of the code execution with the output of the model execution. 
If these outputs are equivalent, it is assumed that the code generator works as expected. 
They evaluate the effectiveness of this approach by means of testing optimizations performed by the TargetLink code generator. 
They have used Simulink as a simulation environment of models. 
In \cite{jorges2014back}, authors presented a testing approach of the Genesys code generator framework which tests the translation performed by a code generator from a semantic perspective rather than just checking for syntactic correctness of the generation result.

Compared to our proposal, none of the previous work has provided an automatic approach for testing and monitoring the generated code in terms of non-functional properties.
